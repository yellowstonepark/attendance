          <p>Unfortunately, you cannot copy and paste participants in a
          Google Meet. However, this is how the program works: the program
          looks at the first textbox, and takes each line as a new classmate.
          Then, it looks for each classmate in the second box. If the program
          finds the name, it records the person as present. If the program does
          not find the name, it records the person as absent. Therefore, it
          does not matter how you have the name in the textbox.</p>
          <p>There is a really good solution that you can use for Google Meets.
          It is not super complicated, and is fairly simple, as long as you
          follow the directions, as follows:</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>It is advised to have a student do the attendance for you, and
          just give them this tutorial.</p>
          <p>Follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>

            <li>In the first textbox, you must paste the students in your
            class.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>Go to Google Classroom</li>
              <li>Pick your class</li>
              <li>Click the word "People" at the top of the page</li>
              <li>Highlight and copy all the students in the class</li>
              <li>Paste it into the first textbox</li>
              <p>***Note: Each name MUST be on a separte line or the program will not work.</p>
            </ol>

            <li>In the second textbox, you must paste the participants. In this case, we will paste the code into the second textbox. It will still work.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>Join the google meet regularly</li>
              <li>Open up the participants tab at the top right (click the button)</li>
              <li>Right click and click "Inspect"</li>
              <li>Scroll all the way up to the second line in the code</li>
              <li>Hover over this line of code <code>&lt;html lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;</code> and click it</li>
              <li>Right click the 3 buttons on the left of the line of code that pops up</li>
              <li>Click "Copy" &gt; "Copy outerHTML"</li>
              <p>***that copies it to your clipboard</p>
              <li>Go to the attendance program, and paste into the second textbox.</li>
            </ol>

            <li>Now just click "Run Attendance"!</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Now that you have taken clicked the button, you will see at the
          bottom a list of who is present and who is absent (each separated by " * ").</p>
